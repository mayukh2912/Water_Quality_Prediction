Water Quality Prediction Model: AICTE INTERNSHIP from Edunet and Shell

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook-based project for predicting water quality using machine learning techniques. The project leverages various Python libraries to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate performance.

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to predict water quality based on relevant features using a machine learning model. The dataset is analyzed, visualized, and processed to train a predictive model, with performance evaluated using standard metrics.

Technologies Used:
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Seaborn: For enhanced statistical visualizations.

Model Performance:
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:
RÂ² Score: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Performance was acceptable across all parameters, indicating the model's reliability for water quality prediction.
